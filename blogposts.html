  		<h3>SGS Blog: Female Artists Through The Years</h3>

		<div class="blogtitle">Carole King: Will You Still Love Me When I Break Boundaries?</div>
		<div class="blogimage1"></div>
		<p>The 1950s were an exciting period for the music industry. Artists were visually appealing and refined; women were singers and pretty faces who danced and performed. There was little room for females any place but the stage. Among the showy choreographed doo-wop artists and girl bands emerged a songwriter hiding in the corners of the infamous Brill Building, writing over 100 hit songs for other artists. Carole King is an illustrious singer songwriter who with humility, power, and talent paved the way for female songwriters in the music industry. After years of writing music on the sidelines, King decided to take her talents into the spotlight at the front of the singer-songwriter movement of the 1970s.  Because of her humble beginnings, she didn’t follow the predestined story that existed for female artists of the past. Theirs was a story of makeup and tightfitting gowns. A story of lights and showy performances. Instead of following their story, she created a new kind of female artist with approach seemingly more authentic. Carole explored a different kind of femininity in her career, not based off looks or stereotypical sexuality, but through honesty and raw talent. King’s connections and reputation from working at the Brill Building lead her to meet artists such as James Taylor, and Joni Mitchell- writers who had established the theme of interiority within music. These were singer-songwriters who captured a perceived authenticity that was eaten up by fans in the 1970s.  People craved a personal relationship with their favorite artists, and so the Singer-Songwriter genre was born. King, inspired by her friends, decided to take her talents into the spotlight releasing her first solo album Writer followed by her hit album Tapestry. King became a forerunner for the new personable genre alongside Mitchel and Taylor. Tapestry received outstanding critical acclaim for lyrics that exemplified internal struggles such as the question “what really is home”?  King also repurposed her previous hit “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow”  with a new, seemingly more profound meaning due to style and inflection. It was no longer a casual and fun song about the whims of female sexuality but became a love ballad infused with yearning and loneliness, real and genuine feelings that people internalized and related to. Carole King is such an important artist for women and songwriters alike. Her stardom was derived from the honest experience of a woman divorcing her teenage love and songwriting partner and attempting a career in a music industry where no one else looked or sounded like she did. Carole accomplished what she did through talent, hard work, friendship, and honesty.  She is a role model not because she rose to the top preaching of woman's rights but acting in a way that was true to herself to break barriers for women. </p>

		<div class="blogtitle">Erykah Badu: Mother of Neo-Soul</div>
		<div class="blogimage2"></div>
		<p>Much of the history of R&B is thought to have taken place in the 20th century with Marvin Gaye, Aretha Franklin, and Big Mama Thorton. While this is true, this history is still being written. For example, this music came into fruition in the late 90s through the genre of neo-soul, and one of the front runners for this new grimy funk sound in my opinion is Erykah Badu with her album Baduizm, released in 1997. Badu incorporated the jazzy vocal textures from singers like Billie Holiday with the energized funk/R&B rhythm section of hip hop to help neo-soul gain traction throughout the late 90s. She, along with artists like D’Angelo and Roy Hargrove created a name for modern R&B. At the forefront of this new movement was Erykah’s leading single to Baduizm: On & On. Baduizm as a whole received incredible reviews from critics, and got Badu nominated for multiple Grammys where she won Best R&B Album and Best Female R&B Performance for On & On. Along with accolades in the early 90s, her music has translated into the 21st century for any lover of R&B/Soul music. She is an artist in which other artists look to for inspiration. 
		Badu was able to create something that encompasses the African American experience through music which is why I believe it is so monumental in the grand scheme of rhythm and blues music. Her lyrics were honest and cool, and the music backing them up all came from a seemingly “authentic” influence of black music.
